# CSC373-Winter2017-Notes
Notes for CSC373 taken during Winter 2017 at the University of Toronto, St George Campus. 
The class was taught by Professor Denis Pankratov. The files were produced using Latex on VIM.

I hope this makes your CSC373 experience less stressful!

DISCLAIMER: These notes might have slight errors (handwritting can be misleading, sometimes!), so please use
your own criteria when using them for your study session.

I will try to update this regularly. Some notes might be missing (I will try to finish them during Reading Week).
